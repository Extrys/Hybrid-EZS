## Introduction
Usually the terms ECS and DOTS are confusing for new developers or for experienced ones with a strong OOP mindset, 
other know about ECS and DOTS but are not sure how to port their project, there are also large projects that would be a nightmare to port to ECS, and let alone DOTS.

This project has been created to solve most of these problems, focusing on offering a much smoother and faster workflow to allow working with Monobehaviours and entities at the same time in a hybrid way.
